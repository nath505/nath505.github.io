## Professional Self-Assessment

During my experience with the SNHU Computer Science program, I’ve learned a lot about software development through various subjects, including computer graphics, mobile architecture, and embedded. These courses and others have introduced me to relevant concepts in today’s industry and have helped to prepare me for employment in a tech-related field. Despite this, I still have much to learn about software development as it pertains to succeeding within a work environment, rather than an academic one. Below, I will give specific examples of how this program has improved my skills in software development:

- CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance

  This course introduced me to unit testing and the importance of identifying and fixing bugs via a testing framework such as JUnit. This has helped to showcase my strengths in ensuring that quality code is produced and maintained throughout the software development lifecycle.

- CS-330: Computational Graphics and Visualization

  This was my first course in computer graphics which introduced concepts such as transforming, texturing, and lighting 3D models to create a rendered scene. I used OpenGL to accomplish common tasks in computer graphics and learned how the GPU renders shapes on a deeper level. This has showcased my strengths in designing and implementing graphical solutions to meet a required goal.

- CS-340: Client/Server Development

  This course informed me about the roles of the client and server, as well as the basic CRUD operations that are used to communicate with a database. These concepts have proven invaluable to my professional goals since databases are used everywhere to store all kinds of information.

Knowing how to collaborate in a team environment is important for being successful in a tech-related field. The Computer Science program has instilled within me a team-focused mindset that emphasizes the acceptance of differences among skillsets and experiences when working with others. Throughout the program, I collaborated with my peers through discussion posts where we shared our ideas and provided differing viewpoints on the course material.

In addition, communicating with stakeholders is crucial for keeping everyone on the same page with the project at hand. I learned about the various stakeholders which are common in the industry, such as Project Managers and Scrum Masters. Each stakeholder has a role to play in ensuring that the project meets the organization’s goals. Maintaining communication with each other through emails and regular meetings can help in this regard.

Data structures and algorithms is a topic that can be difficult to fully grasp. However, it may be the most useful knowledge that a computer science student can have. Algorithms are everywhere in software development. They form the backbone of computer software through logical procedures that enable the code to perform a variety of tasks. Throughout the Computer Science program, I have demonstrated my ability to think algorithmically and use data structures, such as linked lists and binary trees, to meet my academic goals.

Software engineering is more than just writing code and hoping it works. It encompasses a mindset of creating software that adheres to industry standards while taking a systematic approach to testing and debugging code. In terms of my own skills, I have learned about the software development lifecycle, as well as other concepts that are central to software engineering as a discipline, and applied these concepts in my assignments at SNHU.

Databases are where we can store information long-term, in contrast to data stored in volatile memory, such as RAM. The credentials of users and other information related to their accounts are kept in the database to be read, updated, and deleted as necessary. During my time at SNHU, I have developed skills in managing databases to achieve a desired result.

Finally, best practices in security are needed for protecting data from bad actors. Encrypting data in transit over a network and hashing passwords before storing them are examples of exhibiting a security mindset. In the course of my academic pursuit, I have demonstrated my ability to put the privacy and security needs of users first in order to prevent their data from potentially being compromised.

## Summary of Artifacts

Throughout this capstone course, I have showcased my strengths by creating software solutions in three different categories: software engineering and design, data structures and algorithms, and databases.

For the first category, I enhanced a project that uses a binary search tree to sort through a list of courses by transferring the code to a different programming language, thereby demonstrating my ability to adapt to a changing development environment and porting a program to meet an organization’s goals.

For the second category, I enhanced a mobile application developed for Android that functions as an inventory tracker. Originally, the user didn’t have the ability to search through the database for specific items, which was fixed by adding a new search feature along with filters to provide more precise and relevant results.

For the third category, I enhanced a project that calculates interest over a specified period of years by creating a full stack application. With this enhancement, I kept the core functionality of the original code and presented it in an entirely new format, which incorporates user accounts and CRUD operations for performing essential database tasks.

## Category One: Software Engineering and Design

### *Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?*

The artifact that I chose is my final project from CS-300: Data Structures & Algorithms: Analysis & Design. This project consists of a program designed to read course data from a file with comma-separated values. The course data is then sorted by course ID with the use of a binary search tree (BST). The user can interact with the console to perform tasks such as loading a file, printing the entire course list, and printing only a specific course. 

### *Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?*

This artifact shows my ability to create a usable program that incorporates essential concepts in data structures and algorithms (DS&A). Specifically, I learned how to use a BST to sort objects and apply this knowledge within a program that utilizes I/O functionality to produce results. For my enhancement, I transferred the code to Java from C++, as well as implemented better exception handling to prevent the program from crashing unexpectedly. In addition, I organized the program into separate class files, rather than keeping everything in one place. I also used the JUnit framework to test certain functions and showcase my ability to successfully create unit tests for a Java program. 

### *Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?*

Overall, I believe that I’ve met the fourth course outcome with this enhancement. In transferring my original program to another programming language, I have shown that I can implement computing solutions that are not limited by differences in syntax between languages. The unit testing portion of my enhancement demonstrates that I can perform a standard practice in software engineering, which is testing blocks of code to verify that they work as intended. My code also meets industry standards in software design by implementing the Singleton pattern for the BST and adhering to best practices in object-oriented programming, such as data encapsulation. Lastly, I used exception handling techniques, such as try-catch statements, to gracefully handle unexpected input from users. 

### *Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?*

As I was enhancing the artifact, I learned a lot about rewriting a program from one programming language to another. There are subtle differences between Java and C++ that affect how the code should be written and organized. For example, Java doesn’t make use of pointers, instead relying on the “new” keyword to create objects that are allocated to memory automatically. This also makes it possible for garbage collection to work without interference from the programmer. Whereas in C++, programmers can use pointers to directly access parts of memory that they need to work with, manually allocating and freeing memory as needed. A challenge that I faced was getting the course data to load correctly in Java. I had to change the logic in loading courses from a file to better accommodate the differences in syntax from C++. Also, performing the JUnit tests required some troubleshooting to get it set up correctly and working with my project.

## Category Two: Data Structures and Algorithms

### *Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?*

The artifact I’ve used in this enhancement is my final project from CS-360: Mobile Architecture & Development. It is an inventory app created with Android Studio and Java. The app can be used to keep track of items, by both adding new items and updating existing ones, as well as sending SMS messages when an item is out of stock. It uses an SQLite database to store records with each item’s ID, name, and quantity. It also uses another SQLite database to store each user’s login credentials and phone numbers which are used for the SMS functionality. The original, non-enhanced app was created in December 2023.

### *Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure? How was the artifact improved?*

I selected this artifact because it showcases my ability to create apps, which is an important skill to have in an age where many people own smartphones that they use in their daily lives. My app uses a variety of algorithms to perform tasks, such as displaying the items on the main screen and sending SMS messages when an item’s stock is low. For this enhancement, I implemented search functionality into the app, which can be used by tapping on the search bar on the main screen. As the user types into the search bar, their query is sent to the database and displays relevant results in real-time. In addition, I wrote a new function `applyFilters()` in which the search results are sorted based on the criteria that the user has selected:

```
public List<String> applyFilters(List<String> itemList) {
  // use filters to set sort type, order and range values
  String sortType = mFilterList.get(0);
  String sortOrder = mFilterList.get(1);
  String minValue = mFilterList.get(2);
  String maxValue = mFilterList.get(3);

  int size = itemList.size();

  // declare lists for sorting
  List<List<String>> sortedList = new ArrayList<>();
  List<String> temp;

  // divide list to be sorted into names and counts
  int entry = -1;

  for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; i+=2) {
    temp = new ArrayList<>();

    temp.add(itemList.get(++entry));
    temp.add(itemList.get(++entry));

    sortedList.add(temp);
  }

  /* perform any necessary sorting before displaying results */

  // sort by item name
  if (sortType.equals("Alphabetical")) {
      if (sortOrder.equals("Ascending")) {
          sortedList.sort(Comparator.comparing(x -> x.get(0)));
      }
      else if (sortOrder.equals("Descending")) {
          sortedList.sort(Comparator.comparing(x -> x.get(0), Collections.reverseOrder()));
      }
  // sort by item quantity
  } else if (sortType.equals("Quantity")) {
      if (sortOrder.equals("Ascending")) {
          sortedList.sort(Comparator.comparing(x -> Integer.parseInt(x.get(1))));
      }
      else if (sortOrder.equals("Descending")) {
          sortedList.sort(Comparator.comparing(x -> Integer.parseInt(x.get(1)), Collections.reverseOrder()));
      }
  }
  // get range values for sorting, if any
  if (!minValue.equals("")) {
      sortedList.removeIf(list -> Integer.parseInt(list.get(1)) < Integer.parseInt(minValue));
      size -= (size - (sortedList.size() * 2));
  }
  if (!maxValue.equals("")) {
      sortedList.removeIf(list -> Integer.parseInt(list.get(1)) > Integer.parseInt(maxValue));
      size -= (size - (sortedList.size() * 2));
  }

  // clear the original list for newly sorted values
  itemList.clear();
  // reset counter
  entry = 0;

  // rebuild the list with sorted values
  for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; i+=2) {
      itemList.add(sortedList.get(entry).get(0));
      itemList.add(sortedList.get(entry).get(1));

      ++entry;
  }

  // return the sorted list to display in scrollview
  return itemList;
}
```

I also added the ability to log out of the app as well as delete the user’s account from the database. Lastly, I performed other tasks such as cleaning up the app’s design and changing the app icon so that it isn’t the default one.

### *Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?*

I believe I’ve met the third course objective with this enhancement by incorporating search functionality that improves the user experience. For my app, I created search filters that the user can choose from, such as sorting items by alphabetical order or quantity, as well as specifying a range of values for the item’s quantity. For example, returning only a list of items that have a quantity above 10, or between 1 and 5. This is made possible with a custom algorithm that I’ve written in `applyFilters()` which detects the currently active filters, if any, and applies them before displaying the search results. Overall, this enhancement has improved my app significantly by enabling users to not only keep track of their inventory, but also sort through it to quickly find what they’re looking for. During development of this enhancement, I have utilized algorithmic thinking skills to implement a search feature that works well and adds to the user experience.

### *Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?*

Throughout this process, I learned about how developers implement search functionality into their apps. This is useful since searching through a big list of items is preferable over scrolling through it manually to find something. However, getting the filters to work correctly for the search results was a difficult task. I had to work through my algorithm and debug it many times until it functioned as intended. This process was a valuable learning experience for me and forced me to closely study my code to figure out what was going wrong. Not only that, but I learned a lot more about mobile app development in general, which is a useful skillset to have in today’s market. Overall, this enhancement has shown me that, by thinking logically through the code while using effective debugging tools, such as breakpoints, it’s possible to overcome any coding challenge if you put your mind to it.

## Category Three: Databases

### *Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?*

The artifact I’ve used in this enhancement is my final project from CS-210: Programming Languages. It is an interest calculator that was designed to take an initial amount, monthly deposits (if any), yearly interest rate, and number of years for calculating the interest. It was designed as a console application that outputs the year-end interest earned and balances, with and without monthly deposits, to the user. This artifact was completed in February 2023. 

### *Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?*

This artifact seemed to be a good fit for my portfolio. I wanted to include it to showcase my skills in designing an application that uses logic to calculate investments, as well as my ability to document the code, such as functions, with clearly defined comments. I’ve improved the artifact by creating a simple CRUD application, which uses Express for the back-end and React for the front-end. This was my first time using React, but it was a learning experience that I think has helped me to understand more about how single-page applications work. In addition, I used MongoDB for the database, which the server interfaces with to store and retrieve data. The application has account creation functionality, as well as basic authentication of the user when logging in. During registration, the passwords are salted and hashed using bcrypt before touching the database. From that point on, the user’s password entered during login is securely compared against the existing hash generated for that user. 

### *Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?*

I’ve made significant progress in the course objective that I planned to meet by creating a full stack application with CRUD functionality that supports user authentication and password hashing. Specifically, the fifth course outcome deals with the concepts of security and privacy. In this way, I have demonstrated a security-focused mindset that aims to minimize the exposure of sensitive data while also maintaining a user-friendly experience. 

### *Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?*

While enhancing this artifact, I had a lot to learn about React and full stack development in general. Although I have taken a full stack course before, it was mostly guided and didn’t allow for much experimentation of the code. This enhancement has been beneficial for my own personal development using self-taught strategies to expand my knowledge and skills in developing software. Honestly, it was a difficult process with many challenges, but eventually I overcame them to create a fully functioning program that showcases my ability to work with databases. Some of these challenges were related to implementing the various concepts of full stack development. For example, getting everything on the back-end to route correctly, as well as figuring out how to manage cookies and user sessions, had tested my existing skills but also helped to improve them. Thankfully, there are well-known libraries that help with these common tasks, such as jsonwebtoken for generating tokens to authenticate users, as well as bcrypt for creating highly secure hashes of passwords.
